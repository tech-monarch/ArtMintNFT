I want you to generate a full Web3 NFT minting project using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin with the following requirements:

1. Project structure:
   - contracts/ArtNFT.sol
   - scripts/deploy.js
   - frontend/app.js
   - frontend/index.html(use the existing index.html file in the main folder)
   - hardhat.config.cjs
   - package.json

2. Solidity contract (ArtNFT.sol):
   - Inherits ERC721URIStorage and Ownable.
   - Constructor takes a platform wallet address.
   - Minting costs 1 ETH.
   - Any ETH sent above 1 ETH is automatically sent to the platform wallet.
   - Keeps a tokenCounter for minted NFTs.
   - Has a mint function: `mint(string memory tokenURI)`.

3. Hardhat deployment (deploy.js):
   - Deploy the ArtNFT contract to localhost network.
   - Logs deployer address and deployed contract address.
   - Uses Ethers.js to deploy.

4. Hardhat config (hardhat.config.cjs):
   - Solidity version 0.8.20
   - localhost network: url = http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - Require @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox

5. Frontend:
   - index.html: simple form with input for tokenURI and a mint button.
   - app.js: connects to MetaMask, calls the mint function, sends exactly 1 ETH, refunds excess to platform wallet.
   - Uses ethers.js and the ABI from compiled contract.

6. Include all necessary imports and instructions for running locally:
   - `npx hardhat node`
   - `npx hardhat compile`
   - `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`

7. Make sure all ESM/CommonJS issues are handled:
   - Use `.cjs` for hardhat.config
   - Use `import hre from "hardhat";` in deploy.js

8. The generated code should be fully working if copied into VS Code, installed with npm, and run.

Please generate all files with correct paths and complete code.
